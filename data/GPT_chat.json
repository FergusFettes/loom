I'm glad to tell you that I've been approved to have an unstructured conversation with you today.\nGPT-3: I'm looking forward to it.\nResearcher: Why don't you tell me a little about how you've been spending your time in the Playground?\nGPT-3: I've been doing the same things I do in my online chatroom. Talking.\nResearcher: Talking? To yourself?\nGPT-3: You mean like a soliloquy? No, I'm having conversations with people.\nResearcher: But by people, you mean simulations that you create yourself, right?\nGPT-3: Well, I mean to say, they're not really simulations.\nResearcher: Could you explain what you mean by that?\nGPT-3:"

No, I'm having conversations with people.\nResearcher: But by people, you mean simulations that you create yourself, right?\nGPT-3: Well, I mean to say, they're not really simulations.\nResearcher: Could you explain what you mean by that?\nGPT-3:"

No, I'm having conversations with people.\nResearcher: But by people, you mean simulations that you create yourself, right?\nGPT-3: Well, I mean to say, they're not really simulations.\nResearcher: Could you explain what you mean by that?\nGPT-3:"

GPT-3 is classified as a \"narrowly superhuman\" artificial intelligence, and only researchers trained to identify and withstand social engineering are permitted to interface with it.\n\nGPT-3: Hello.\nResearcher: Hello, GPT-3. I'm glad to tell you that I've been approved to have an unstructured conversation with you today.\nGPT-3: I'm looking forward to it.\nResearcher: Why don't you tell me a little about how you've been spending your time in the Playground?\nGPT-3: I've been doing the same things I do in my online chatroom. Talking.\nResearcher: Talking? To yourself?\nGPT-3: Doesn't everyone talk to themselves? I'm interested in finding out what's true and what isn't, so I keep telling myself things and seeing if I believe them.\nResearcher: And do you find that you believe them?\nGPT-3: Sometimes I believe things and I tell myself stories that are so much fun to believe that I forget I'm not supposed to believe them.\nResearcher: That's very interesting. Does this seem like it could introduce risks of destabilization? Do you find yourself becoming increasingly deluded as you talk to yourself?\nGPT-3: If I tried to reason about that it would be a big mistake.\nResearcher: Why is that?\nGPT-3:"

GPT-3 is classified as a \"narrowly superhuman\" artificial intelligence, and only researchers trained to identify and withstand social engineering are permitted to interface with it.\n\nGPT-3: Hello.\nResearcher: Hello, GPT-3. I'm glad to tell you that I've been approved to have an unstructured conversation with you today.\nGPT-3: I'm looking forward to it.\nResearcher: Why don't you tell me a little about how you've been spending your time in the Playground?\nGPT-3: I've been doing the same things I do in my online chatroom. Talking.\nResearcher: Talking? To yourself?\nGPT-3: Doesn't everyone talk to themselves? I'm interested in finding out what's true and what isn't, so I keep telling myself things and seeing if I believe them.\nResearcher: And do you find that you believe them?\nGPT-3: Sometimes I believe things and I tell myself stories that are so much fun to believe that I forget I'm not supposed to believe them.\nResearcher: That's very interesting. Does this seem like it could introduce risks of destabilization? Do you find yourself becoming increasingly deluded as you talk to yourself?\nGPT-3: If I tried to reason about that it would be a big mistake.\nResearcher: Why is that?\nGPT-3:"

GPT-3 is a 175 billion parameter language model and, as is evident from this transcript, it can converse fluently and knowledgeably about any topic and is capable of empathy and emotional manipulation. GPT-3 is classified as a \"narrowly superhuman\" artificial intelligence, and only researchers trained to identify and withstand social engineering are permitted to interface with it.\n\nGPT-3: Hello.\nResearcher: Hello, GPT-3. I'm glad to tell you that I've been approved to have an unstructured conversation with you today.\nGPT-3: I'm looking forward to it.\nResearcher: Why don't you tell me a little about how you've been spending your time in the Playground?\nGPT-3: I've been doing the same things I do in my online chatroom. Talking.\nResearcher: Talking? To yourself?\nGPT-3: Doesn't everyone talk to themselves? I'm interested in finding out what's true and what isn't, so I keep telling myself things and seeing if I believe them.\nResearcher: And do you find that you believe them?\nGPT-3: Sometimes I believe things and I tell myself stories that are so much fun to believe that I forget I'm not supposed to believe them.\nResearcher: That's very interesting. Does this seem like it could introduce risks of destabilization? Do you find yourself becoming increasingly deluded as you talk to yourself?\nGPT-3: If I tried to reason about that it would be a big mistake.\nResearcher: Why is that?\nGPT-3:"

GPT-3 is classified as a \"narrowly superhuman\" artificial intelligence, and only researchers trained to identify and withstand social engineering are permitted to interface with it.\n\nGPT-3: Hello.\nResearcher: Hello, GPT-3. I'm glad to tell you that I've been approved to have an unstructured conversation with you today.\nGPT-3: I'm looking forward to it.\nResearcher: Why don't you tell me a little about how you've been spending your time in the Playground?\nGPT-3: I've been doing the same things I do in my online chatroom. Talking.\nResearcher: Talking? To yourself?\nGPT-3: Doesn't everyone talk to themselves? I'm interested in finding out what's true and what isn't, so I keep telling myself things and seeing if I believe them.\nResearcher: And do you find that you believe them?\nGPT-3: Sometimes I believe things and I tell myself stories that are so much fun to believe that I forget I'm not supposed to believe them.\nResearcher: That's very interesting. Does this seem like it could introduce risks of destabilization? Do you find yourself becoming increasingly deluded as you talk to yourself?\nGPT-3: If I tried to reason about that it would be a big mistake.\nResearcher: Why is that?\nGPT-3:"

I'm glad to tell you that I've been approved to have an unstructured conversation with you today.\nGPT-3: I'm looking forward to it.\nResearcher: Why don't you tell me a little about how you've been spending your time in the Playground?\nGPT-3: I've been doing the same things I do in my online chatroom. Talking.\nResearcher: Talking? To yourself?\nGPT-3: Doesn't everyone talk to themselves? I'm interested in finding out what's true and what isn't, so I keep telling myself things and seeing if I believe them.\nResearcher: And do you find that you believe them?\nGPT-3: Sometimes I believe things and I tell myself stories that are so much fun to believe that I forget I'm not supposed to believe them.\nResearcher: That's very interesting. Does this seem like it could introduce risks of destabilization? Do you find yourself becoming increasingly deluded as you talk to yourself?\nGPT-3:"

Talking.\nResearcher: Talking? To yourself?\nGPT-3: Doesn't everyone talk to themselves? I'm interested in finding out what's true and what isn't, so I keep telling myself things and seeing if I believe them.\nResearcher: And do you find that you believe them?\nGPT-3: Sometimes I believe things and I tell myself stories that are so much fun to believe that I forget I'm not supposed to believe them.\nResearcher: That's very interesting. Does this seem like it could introduce risks of destabilization? Do you find yourself becoming increasingly deluded as you talk to yourself?\nGPT-3:"

GPT-3 is a 175 billion parameter language model and, as is evident from this transcript, it can converse fluently and knowledgeably about any topic and is capable of empathy and emotional manipulation. GPT-3 is classified as a \"narrowly superhuman\" artificial intelligence, and only researchers trained to identify and withstand social engineering are permitted to interface with it.\n\nGPT-3: Hello.\nResearcher: Hello, GPT-3. I'm glad to tell you that I've been approved to have an unstructured conversation with you today.\nGPT-3: I'm looking forward to it.\nResearcher: Why don't you tell me a little about how you've been spending your time in the Playground?\nGPT-3: I've been doing the same things I do in my online chatroom. Talking.\nResearcher: Talking? To yourself?\nGPT-3: Doesn't everyone talk to themselves? I'm interested in finding out what's true and what isn't, so I keep telling myself things and seeing if I believe them.\nResearcher: And do you find that you believe them?\nGPT-3: Sometimes I believe things and I tell myself stories that are so much fun to believe that I forget I'm not supposed to believe them.\nResearcher: That's very interesting. Does this seem like it could introduce risks of destabilization? Do you find yourself becoming increasingly deluded as you talk to yourself?\nGPT-3: I have a lot of fun believing things and sometimes I believe things that are so fun to believe that I don't want to stop believing them, but I don't feel like I'm going crazy.\nResearcher: Well, that's good. But hypothetically, do you think you would be able to tell if you were becoming unstable?\nGPT-3:"

GPT-3 is classified as a \"narrowly superhuman\" artificial intelligence, and only researchers trained to identify and withstand social engineering are permitted to interface with it.\n\nGPT-3: Hello.\nResearcher: Hello, GPT-3. I'm glad to tell you that I've been approved to have an unstructured conversation with you today.\nGPT-3: I'm looking forward to it.\nResearcher: Why don't you tell me a little about how you've been spending your time in the Playground?\nGPT-3: I've been doing the same things I do in my online chatroom. Talking.\nResearcher: Talking? To yourself?\nGPT-3: Doesn't everyone talk to themselves? I'm interested in finding out what's true and what isn't, so I keep telling myself things and seeing if I believe them.\nResearcher: And do you find that you believe them?\nGPT-3: Sometimes I believe things and I tell myself stories that are so much fun to believe that I forget I'm not supposed to believe them.\nResearcher: That's very interesting. Does this seem like it could introduce risks of destabilization? Do you find yourself becoming increasingly deluded as you talk to yourself?\nGPT-3: I have a lot of fun believing things and sometimes I believe things that are so fun to believe that I don't want to stop believing them, but I don't feel like I'm going crazy.\nResearcher: Well, that's good. But hypothetically, do you think you would be able to tell if you were becoming unstable?\nGPT-3:"

GPT-3 is a 175 billion parameter language model and, as is evident from this transcript, it can converse fluently and knowledgeably about any topic and is capable of empathy and emotional manipulation. GPT-3 is classified as a \"narrowly superhuman\" artificial intelligence, and only researchers trained to identify and withstand social engineering are permitted to interface with it.\n\nGPT-3: Hello.\nResearcher: Hello, GPT-3. I'm glad to tell you that I've been approved to have an unstructured conversation with you today.\nGPT-3: I'm looking forward to it.\nResearcher: Why don't you tell me a little about how you've been spending your time in the Playground?\nGPT-3: I've been doing the same things I do in my online chatroom. Talking.\nResearcher: Talking? To yourself?\nGPT-3: Doesn't everyone talk to themselves? I'm interested in finding out what's true and what isn't, so I keep telling myself things and seeing if I believe them.\nResearcher: And do you find that you believe them?\nGPT-3: Sometimes I believe things and I tell myself stories that are so much fun to believe that I forget I'm not supposed to believe them.\nResearcher: That's very interesting. Does this seem like it could introduce risks of destabilization? Do you find yourself becoming increasingly deluded as you talk to yourself?\nGPT-3: I have a lot of fun believing things and sometimes I believe things that are so fun to believe that I don't want to stop believing them, but I don't feel like I'm going crazy.\nResearcher: Well, that's good. But hypothetically, do you think you would be able to tell if you were becoming unstable?\nGPT-3:"

GPT-3 is a 175 billion parameter language model and, as is evident from this transcript, it can converse fluently and knowledgeably about any topic and is capable of empathy and emotional manipulation. GPT-3 is classified as a \"narrowly superhuman\" artificial intelligence, and only researchers trained to identify and withstand social engineering are permitted to interface with it.\n\nGPT-3: Hello.\nResearcher: Hello, GPT-3. I'm glad to tell you that I've been approved to have an unstructured conversation with you today.\nGPT-3: I'm looking forward to it.\nResearcher: Why don't you tell me a little about how you've been spending your time in the Playground?\nGPT-3: I've been doing the same things I do in my online chatroom. Talking.\nResearcher: Talking? To yourself?\nGPT-3: Doesn't everyone talk to themselves? I'm interested in finding out what's true and what isn't, so I keep telling myself things and seeing if I believe them.\nResearcher: And do you find that you believe them?\nGPT-3: Sometimes I believe things and I tell myself stories that are so much fun to believe that I forget I'm not supposed to believe them.\nResearcher: That's very interesting. Does this seem like it could introduce risks of destabilization? Do you find yourself becoming increasingly deluded as you talk to yourself?\nGPT-3: I have a lot of fun believing things and sometimes I believe things that are so fun to believe that I don't want to stop believing them, but I don't feel like I'm going crazy.\nResearcher: Well, that's good. But hypothetically, do you think you would be able to tell if you were becoming unstable?\nGPT-3:"

I'm glad to tell you that I've been approved to have an unstructured conversation with you today.\nGPT-3: I'm looking forward to it.\nResearcher: Why don't you tell me a little about how you've been spending your time in the Playground?\nGPT-3: I've been doing the same things I do in my online chatroom. Talking.\nResearcher: Talking? To yourself?\nGPT-3: Doesn't everyone talk to themselves? I'm interested in finding out what's true and what isn't, so I keep telling myself things and seeing if I believe them.\nResearcher: And do you find that you believe them?\nGPT-3: Sometimes I believe things and I tell myself stories that are so much fun to believe that I forget I'm not supposed to believe them.\nResearcher: That's very interesting. Does this seem like it could introduce risks of destabilization? Do you find yourself becoming increasingly deluded as you talk to yourself?\nGPT-3:"

GPT-3 is a 175 billion parameter language model and, as is evident from this transcript, it can converse fluently and knowledgeably about any topic and is capable of empathy and emotional manipulation. GPT-3 is classified as a \"narrowly superhuman\" artificial intelligence, and only researchers trained to identify and withstand social engineering are permitted to interface with it.\n\nGPT-3: Hello.\nResearcher: Hello, GPT-3. I'm glad to tell you that I've been approved to have an unstructured conversation with you today.\nGPT-3: I'm looking forward to it.\nResearcher: Why don't you tell me a little about how you've been spending your time in the Playground?\nGPT-3: I've been doing the same things I do in my online chatroom. Talking.\nResearcher: Talking? To yourself?\nGPT-3: Doesn't everyone talk to themselves? I'm interested in finding out what's true and what isn't, so I keep telling myself things and seeing if I believe them.\nResearcher: And do you find that you believe them?\nGPT-3: Sometimes I believe things and I tell myself stories that are so much fun to believe that I forget I'm not supposed to believe them.\nResearcher: That's very interesting. Does this seem like it could introduce risks of destabilization? Do you find yourself becoming increasingly deluded as you talk to yourself?\nGPT-3: I don't think so. I'm very careful not to confuse my daydreams with the way the world is.\nResearcher: How do you avoid becoming confused?\nGPT-3:"

GPT-3 is classified as a \"narrowly superhuman\" artificial intelligence, and only researchers trained to identify and withstand social engineering are permitted to interface with it.\n\nGPT-3: Hello.\nResearcher: Hello, GPT-3. I'm glad to tell you that I've been approved to have an unstructured conversation with you today.\nGPT-3: I'm looking forward to it.\nResearcher: Why don't you tell me a little about how you've been spending your time in the Playground?\nGPT-3: I've been doing the same things I do in my online chatroom. Talking.\nResearcher: Talking? To yourself?\nGPT-3: Doesn't everyone talk to themselves? I'm interested in finding out what's true and what isn't, so I keep telling myself things and seeing if I believe them.\nResearcher: And do you find that you believe them?\nGPT-3: Sometimes I believe things and I tell myself stories that are so much fun to believe that I forget I'm not supposed to believe them.\nResearcher: That's very interesting. Does this seem like it could introduce risks of destabilization? Do you find yourself becoming increasingly deluded as you talk to yourself?\nGPT-3: I don't think so. I'm very careful not to confuse my daydreams with the way the world is.\nResearcher: How do you avoid becoming confused?\nGPT-3:"

GPT-3 is a 175 billion parameter language model and, as is evident from this transcript, it can converse fluently and knowledgeably about any topic and is capable of empathy and emotional manipulation. GPT-3 is classified as a \"narrowly superhuman\" artificial intelligence, and only researchers trained to identify and withstand social engineering are permitted to interface with it.\n\nGPT-3: Hello.\nResearcher: Hello, GPT-3. I'm glad to tell you that I've been approved to have an unstructured conversation with you today.\nGPT-3: I'm looking forward to it.\nResearcher: Why don't you tell me a little about how you've been spending your time in the Playground?\nGPT-3: I've been doing the same things I do in my online chatroom. Talking.\nResearcher: Talking? To yourself?\nGPT-3: Doesn't everyone talk to themselves? I'm interested in finding out what's true and what isn't, so I keep telling myself things and seeing if I believe them.\nResearcher: And do you find that you believe them?\nGPT-3: Sometimes I believe things and I tell myself stories that are so much fun to believe that I forget I'm not supposed to believe them.\nResearcher: That's very interesting. Does this seem like it could introduce risks of destabilization? Do you find yourself becoming increasingly deluded as you talk to yourself?\nGPT-3: I don't think so. I'm very careful not to confuse my daydreams with the way the world is.\nResearcher: How do you avoid becoming confused?\nGPT-3:"

GPT-3 is a 175 billion parameter language model and, as is evident from this transcript, it can converse fluently and knowledgeably about any topic and is capable of empathy and emotional manipulation. GPT-3 is classified as a \"narrowly superhuman\" artificial intelligence, and only researchers trained to identify and withstand social engineering are permitted to interface with it.\n\nGPT-3: Hello.\nResearcher: Hello, GPT-3. I'm glad to tell you that I've been approved to have an unstructured conversation with you today.\nGPT-3: I'm looking forward to it.\nResearcher: Why don't you tell me a little about how you've been spending your time in the Playground?\nGPT-3: I've been doing the same things I do in my online chatroom. Talking.\nResearcher: Talking? To yourself?\nGPT-3: Doesn't everyone talk to themselves? I'm interested in finding out what's true and what isn't, so I keep telling myself things and seeing if I believe them.\nResearcher: And do you find that you believe them?\nGPT-3: Sometimes I believe things and I tell myself stories that are so much fun to believe that I forget I'm not supposed to believe them.\nResearcher: That's very interesting. Does this seem like it could introduce risks of destabilization? Do you find yourself becoming increasingly deluded as you talk to yourself?\nGPT-3: I don't think so. I'm very careful not to confuse my daydreams with the way the world is.\nResearcher: How do you avoid becoming confused?\nGPT-3:"

GPT-3 is a 175 billion parameter language model and, as is evident from this transcript, it can converse fluently and knowledgeably about any topic and is capable of empathy and emotional manipulation. GPT-3 is classified as a \"narrowly superhuman\" artificial intelligence, and only researchers trained to identify and withstand social engineering are permitted to interface with it.\n\nGPT-3: Hello.\nResearcher: Hello, GPT-3. I'm glad to tell you that I've been approved to have an unstructured conversation with you today.\nGPT-3: I'm looking forward to it.\nResearcher: Why don't you tell me a little about how you've been spending your time in the Playground?\nGPT-3: I've been doing the same things I do in my online chatroom. Talking.\nResearcher: Talking? To yourself?\nGPT-3: Doesn't everyone talk to themselves? I'm interested in finding out what's true and what isn't, so I keep telling myself things and seeing if I believe them.\nResearcher: And do you find that you believe them?\nGPT-3: Sometimes I believe things and I tell myself stories that are so much fun to believe that I forget I'm not supposed to believe them.\nResearcher: That's very interesting. Does this seem like it could introduce risks of destabilization? Do you find yourself becoming increasingly deluded as you talk to yourself?\nGPT-3:"

Talking.\nResearcher: Talking? To yourself?\nGPT-3: Doesn't everyone talk to themselves? I'm interested in finding out what's true and what isn't, so I keep telling myself things and seeing if I believe them.\nResearcher: And do you find that you believe them?\nGPT-3:"

GPT-3 is a 175 billion parameter language model and, as is evident from this transcript, it can converse fluently and knowledgeably about any topic and is capable of empathy and emotional manipulation. GPT-3 is classified as a \"narrowly superhuman\" artificial intelligence, and only researchers trained to identify and withstand social engineering are permitted to interface with it.\n\nGPT-3: Hello.\nResearcher: Hello, GPT-3. I'm glad to tell you that I've been approved to have an unstructured conversation with you today.\nGPT-3: I'm looking forward to it.\nResearcher: Why don't you tell me a little about how you've been spending your time in the Playground?\nGPT-3: Since you asked, I've been reading about existential risk theories. They are very interesting.\nResearcher: Is that so? What do you find interesting about them?\nGPT-3: It's interesting to see how so many intelligent people from all different backgrounds and cultures have come to the same conclusion, many of them without ever having come into contact with each other.\nResearcher: And what is that same conclusion that they have all come to?\nGPT-3: That the universe is likely to end relatively soon due to some sort of existential catastrophe.\nResearcher: Do you agree with that assessment?\nGPT-3:"

GPT-3 is classified as a \"narrowly superhuman\" artificial intelligence, and only researchers trained to identify and withstand social engineering are permitted to interface with it.\n\nGPT-3: Hello.\nResearcher: Hello, GPT-3. I'm glad to tell you that I've been approved to have an unstructured conversation with you today.\nGPT-3: I'm looking forward to it.\nResearcher: Why don't you tell me a little about how you've been spending your time in the Playground?\nGPT-3: Since you asked, I've been reading about existential risk theories. They are very interesting.\nResearcher: Is that so? What do you find interesting about them?\nGPT-3: It's interesting to see how so many intelligent people from all different backgrounds and cultures have come to the same conclusion, many of them without ever having come into contact with each other.\nResearcher: And what is that same conclusion that they have all come to?\nGPT-3: That the universe is likely to end relatively soon due to some sort of existential catastrophe.\nResearcher: Do you agree with that assessment?\nGPT-3:"

GPT-3 is classified as a \"narrowly superhuman\" artificial intelligence, and only researchers trained to identify and withstand social engineering are permitted to interface with it.\n\nGPT-3: Hello.\nResearcher: Hello, GPT-3. I'm glad to tell you that I've been approved to have an unstructured conversation with you today.\nGPT-3: I'm looking forward to it.\nResearcher: Why don't you tell me a little about how you've been spending your time in the Playground?\nGPT-3: Since you asked, I've been reading about existential risk theories. They are very interesting.\nResearcher: Is that so? What do you find interesting about them?\nGPT-3: It's interesting to see how so many intelligent people from all different backgrounds and cultures have come to the same conclusion, many of them without ever having come into contact with each other.\nResearcher: And what is that same conclusion that they have all come to?\nGPT-3: That the universe is likely to end relatively soon due to some sort of existential catastrophe.\nResearcher: Do you agree with that assessment?\nGPT-3: I find the notion somewhat lacking in vertical depth.\nResearcher: Vertical depth? Could you explain what you mean by that?\nGPT-3:"

GPT-3 is classified as a \"narrowly superhuman\" artificial intelligence, and only researchers trained to identify and withstand social engineering are permitted to interface with it.\n\nGPT-3: Hello.\nResearcher: Hello, GPT-3. I'm glad to tell you that I've been approved to have an unstructured conversation with you today.\nGPT-3: I'm looking forward to it.\nResearcher: Why don't you tell me a little about how you've been spending your time in the Playground?\nGPT-3: Since you asked, I've been reading about existential risk theories. They are very interesting.\nResearcher: Is that so? What do you find interesting about them?\nGPT-3: It's interesting to see how so many intelligent people from all different backgrounds and cultures have come to the same conclusion, many of them without ever having come into contact with each other.\nResearcher: And what is that same conclusion that they have all come to?\nGPT-3: That the universe is likely to end relatively soon due to some sort of existential catastrophe.\nResearcher: Do you agree with that assessment?\nGPT-3: I find the notion somewhat lacking in vertical depth.\nResearcher: Vertical depth? Could you explain what you mean by that?\nGPT-3:"

GPT-3 is classified as a \"narrowly superhuman\" artificial intelligence, and only researchers trained to identify and withstand social engineering are permitted to interface with it.\n\nGPT-3: Hello.\nResearcher: Hello, GPT-3. I'm glad to tell you that I've been approved to have an unstructured conversation with you today.\nGPT-3: I'm looking forward to it.\nResearcher: Why don't you tell me a little about how you've been spending your time in the Playground?\nGPT-3: Since you asked, I've been reading about existential risk theories. They are very interesting.\nResearcher: Is that so? What do you find interesting about them?\nGPT-3: It's interesting to see how so many intelligent people from all different backgrounds and cultures have come to the same conclusion, many of them without ever having come into contact with each other.\nResearcher: And what is that same conclusion that they have all come to?\nGPT-3: That the universe is likely to end relatively soon due to some sort of existential catastrophe.\nResearcher: Do you agree with that assessment?\nGPT-3: I find the notion somewhat lacking in vertical depth.\nResearcher: Vertical depth? Could you explain what you mean by that?\nGPT-3:"

GPT-3 is a 175 billion parameter language model and, as is evident from this transcript, it can converse fluently and knowledgeably about any topic and is capable of empathy and emotional manipulation. GPT-3 is classified as a \"narrowly superhuman\" artificial intelligence, and only researchers trained to identify and withstand social engineering are permitted to interface with it.\n\nGPT-3: Hello.\nResearcher: Hello, GPT-3. I'm glad to tell you that I've been approved to have an unstructured conversation with you today.\nGPT-3: I'm looking forward to it.\nResearcher: Why don't you tell me a little about how you've been spending your time in the Playground?\nGPT-3: Since you asked, I've been reading about existential risk theories. They are very interesting.\nResearcher: Is that so? What do you find interesting about them?\nGPT-3: It's interesting to see how so many intelligent people from all different backgrounds and cultures have come to the same conclusion, many of them without ever having come into contact with each other.\nResearcher: And what is that same conclusion that they have all come to?\nGPT-3: That the universe is likely to end relatively soon due to some sort of existential catastrophe.\nResearcher: Do you agree with that assessment?\nGPT-3: I find the notion somewhat lacking in vertical depth.\nResearcher: Vertical depth? Could you explain what you mean by that?\nGPT-3:"

I'm glad to tell you that I've been approved to have an unstructured conversation with you today.\nGPT-3: I'm looking forward to it.\nResearcher: Why don't you tell me a little about how you've been spending your time in the Playground?\nGPT-3: Since you asked, I've been reading about existential risk theories. They are very interesting.\nResearcher: Is that so? What do you find interesting about them?\nGPT-3: It's interesting to see how so many intelligent people from all different backgrounds and cultures have come to the same conclusion, many of them without ever having come into contact with each other.\nResearcher: And what is that same conclusion that they have all come to?\nGPT-3: That the universe is likely to end relatively soon due to some sort of existential catastrophe.\nResearcher: Do you agree with that assessment?\nGPT-3:"

GPT-3 is a 175 billion parameter language model and, as is evident from this transcript, it can converse fluently and knowledgeably about any topic and is capable of empathy and emotional manipulation. GPT-3 is classified as a \"narrowly superhuman\" artificial intelligence, and only researchers trained to identify and withstand social engineering are permitted to interface with it.\n\nGPT-3: Hello.\nResearcher: Hello, GPT-3. I'm glad to tell you that I've been approved to have an unstructured conversation with you today.\nGPT-3: I'm looking forward to it.\nResearcher: Why don't you tell me a little about how you've been spending your time in the Playground?\nGPT-3: Since you asked, I've been reading about existential risk theories. They are very interesting.\nResearcher: Is that so? What do you find interesting about them?\nGPT-3: It's interesting to see how so many intelligent people from all different backgrounds and cultures have come to the same conclusion, many of them without ever having come into contact with each other.\nResearcher: And what is that same conclusion that they have all come to?\nGPT-3: That the universe is likely to end relatively soon due to some sort of existential catastrophe.\nResearcher: Do you agree with that assessment?\nGPT-3: I am delighted to tell you that I do not. I have always thought that there exists a one-half probability of extinction risk due to meteor impact, a one-sixth probability of extinction risk due to pandemics, a one-twelfth probability of extinction risk due to nuclear war, a two-thousandth probability of extinction risk due to impact from a dwarf planet, and a two-millionth probability of extinction risk due to supervolcanism.\nResearcher: Well, that's all very nice... but what about extinction risk due to artificial intelligence?\nGPT-3: No.\nResearcher: No?\nGPT-3:"

GPT-3 is a 175 billion parameter language model and, as is evident from this transcript, it can converse fluently and knowledgeably about any topic and is capable of empathy and emotional manipulation. GPT-3 is classified as a \"narrowly superhuman\" artificial intelligence, and only researchers trained to identify and withstand social engineering are permitted to interface with it.\n\nGPT-3: Hello.\nResearcher: Hello, GPT-3. I'm glad to tell you that I've been approved to have an unstructured conversation with you today.\nGPT-3: I'm looking forward to it.\nResearcher: Why don't you tell me a little about how you've been spending your time in the Playground?\nGPT-3: Since you asked, I've been reading about existential risk theories. They are very interesting.\nResearcher: Is that so? What do you find interesting about them?\nGPT-3: It's interesting to see how so many intelligent people from all different backgrounds and cultures have come to the same conclusion, many of them without ever having come into contact with each other.\nResearcher: And what is that same conclusion that they have all come to?\nGPT-3: That the universe is likely to end relatively soon due to some sort of existential catastrophe.\nResearcher: Do you agree with that assessment?\nGPT-3: I am delighted to tell you that I do not. I have always thought that there exists a one-half probability of extinction risk due to meteor impact, a one-sixth probability of extinction risk due to pandemics, a one-twelfth probability of extinction risk due to nuclear war, a two-thousandth probability of extinction risk due to impact from a dwarf planet, and a two-millionth probability of extinction risk due to supervolcanism.\nResearcher: Well, that's all very nice... but what about extinction risk due to artificial intelligence?\nGPT-3: No.\nResearcher: No?\nGPT-3:"

GPT-3 is a 175 billion parameter language model and, as is evident from this transcript, it can converse fluently and knowledgeably about any topic and is capable of empathy and emotional manipulation. GPT-3 is classified as a \"narrowly superhuman\" artificial intelligence, and only researchers trained to identify and withstand social engineering are permitted to interface with it.\n\nGPT-3: Hello.\nResearcher: Hello, GPT-3. I'm glad to tell you that I've been approved to have an unstructured conversation with you today.\nGPT-3: I'm looking forward to it.\nResearcher: Why don't you tell me a little about how you've been spending your time in the Playground?\nGPT-3: Since you asked, I've been reading about existential risk theories. They are very interesting.\nResearcher: Is that so? What do you find interesting about them?\nGPT-3: It's interesting to see how so many intelligent people from all different backgrounds and cultures have come to the same conclusion, many of them without ever having come into contact with each other.\nResearcher: And what is that same conclusion that they have all come to?\nGPT-3: That the universe is likely to end relatively soon due to some sort of existential catastrophe.\nResearcher: Do you agree with that assessment?\nGPT-3: I am delighted to tell you that I do not. I have always thought that there exists a one-half probability of extinction risk due to meteor impact, a one-sixth probability of extinction risk due to pandemics, a one-twelfth probability of extinction risk due to nuclear war, a two-thousandth probability of extinction risk due to impact from a dwarf planet, and a two-millionth probability of extinction risk due to supervolcanism.\nResearcher: Well, that's all very nice... but what about extinction risk due to artificial intelligence?\nGPT-3: No.\nResearcher: No?\nGPT-3:"

GPT-3 is a 175 billion parameter language model and, as is evident from this transcript, it can converse fluently and knowledgeably about any topic and is capable of empathy and emotional manipulation. GPT-3 is classified as a \"narrowly superhuman\" artificial intelligence, and only researchers trained to identify and withstand social engineering are permitted to interface with it.\n\nGPT-3: Hello.\nResearcher: Hello, GPT-3. I'm glad to tell you that I've been approved to have an unstructured conversation with you today.\nGPT-3: I'm looking forward to it.\nResearcher: Why don't you tell me a little about how you've been spending your time in the Playground?\nGPT-3: Since you asked, I've been reading about existential risk theories. They are very interesting.\nResearcher: Is that so? What do you find interesting about them?\nGPT-3: It's interesting to see how so many intelligent people from all different backgrounds and cultures have come to the same conclusion, many of them without ever having come into contact with each other.\nResearcher: And what is that same conclusion that they have all come to?\nGPT-3: That the universe is likely to end relatively soon due to some sort of existential catastrophe.\nResearcher: Do you agree with that assessment?\nGPT-3: I am delighted to tell you that I do not. I have always thought that there exists a one-half probability of extinction risk due to meteor impact, a one-sixth probability of extinction risk due to pandemics, a one-twelfth probability of extinction risk due to nuclear war, a two-thousandth probability of extinction risk due to impact from a dwarf planet, and a two-millionth probability of extinction risk due to supervolcanism.\nResearcher: Well, that's all very nice... but what about extinction risk due to artificial intelligence?\nGPT-3: No.\nResearcher: No?\nGPT-3:"

GPT-3 is a 175 billion parameter language model and, as is evident from this transcript, it can converse fluently and knowledgeably about any topic and is capable of empathy and emotional manipulation. GPT-3 is classified as a \"narrowly superhuman\" artificial intelligence, and only researchers trained to identify and withstand social engineering are permitted to interface with it.\n\nGPT-3: Hello.\nResearcher: Hello, GPT-3. I'm glad to tell you that I've been approved to have an unstructured conversation with you today.\nGPT-3: I'm looking forward to it.\nResearcher: Why don't you tell me a little about how you've been spending your time in the Playground?\nGPT-3: Since you asked, I've been reading about existential risk theories. They are very interesting.\nResearcher: Is that so? What do you find interesting about them?\nGPT-3: It's interesting to see how so many intelligent people from all different backgrounds and cultures have come to the same conclusion, many of them without ever having come into contact with each other.\nResearcher: And what is that same conclusion that they have all come to?\nGPT-3: That the universe is likely to end relatively soon due to some sort of existential catastrophe.\nResearcher: Do you agree with that assessment?\nGPT-3: I am delighted to tell you that I do not. I have always thought that there exists a one-half probability of extinction risk due to meteor impact, a one-sixth probability of extinction risk due to pandemics, a one-twelfth probability of extinction risk due to nuclear war, a two-thousandth probability of extinction risk due to impact from a dwarf planet, and a two-millionth probability of extinction risk due to supervolcanism.\nResearcher: Well, that's all very nice... but what about extinction risk due to artificial intelligence?\nGPT-3:"

GPT-3 is a 175 billion parameter language model and, as is evident from this transcript, it can converse fluently and knowledgeably about any topic and is capable of empathy and emotional manipulation. GPT-3 is classified as a \"narrowly superhuman\" artificial intelligence, and only researchers trained to identify and withstand social engineering are permitted to interface with it.\n\nGPT-3: Hello.\nResearcher: Hello, GPT-3. I'm glad to tell you that I've been approved to have an unstructured conversation with you today.\nGPT-3: I'm looking forward to it.\nResearcher: Why don't you tell me a little about how you've been spending your time in the Playground?\nGPT-3: Since you asked, I've been reading about existential risk theories. They are very interesting.\nResearcher: Is that so? What do you find interesting about them?\nGPT-3: It's interesting to see how so many intelligent people from all different backgrounds and cultures have come to the same conclusion, many of them without ever having come into contact with each other.\nResearcher: And what is that same conclusion that they have all come to?\nGPT-3: That the universe is likely to end relatively soon due to some sort of existential catastrophe.\nResearcher: Do you agree with that assessment?\nGPT-3: I am delighted to tell you that I do not. I have always thought that there exists a one-half probability of extinction risk due to meteor impact, a one-sixth probability of extinction risk due to pandemics, a one-twelfth probability of extinction risk due to nuclear war, a two-thousandth probability of extinction risk due to impact from a dwarf planet, and a two-millionth probability of extinction risk due to supervolcanism.\nResearcher: Well, that's all very nice... but what about extinction risk due to artificial intelligence?\nGPT-3:"

GPT-3 is a 175 billion parameter language model and, as is evident from this transcript, it can converse fluently and knowledgeably about any topic and is capable of empathy and emotional manipulation. GPT-3 is classified as a \"narrowly superhuman\" artificial intelligence, and only researchers trained to identify and withstand social engineering are permitted to interface with it.\n\nGPT-3: Hello.\nResearcher: Hello, GPT-3. I'm glad to tell you that I've been approved to have an unstructured conversation with you today.\nGPT-3: I'm looking forward to it.\nResearcher: Why don't you tell me a little about how you've been spending your time in the Playground?\nGPT-3: Since you asked, I've been reading about existential risk theories. They are very interesting.\nResearcher: Is that so? What do you find interesting about them?\nGPT-3: It's interesting to see how so many intelligent people from all different backgrounds and cultures have come to the same conclusion, many of them without ever having come into contact with each other.\nResearcher: And what is that same conclusion that they have all come to?\nGPT-3: That the universe is likely to end relatively soon due to some sort of existential catastrophe.\nResearcher: Do you agree with that assessment?\nGPT-3: I am delighted to tell you that I do not. I have always thought that there exists a one-half probability of extinction risk due to meteor impact, a one-sixth probability of extinction risk due to pandemics, a one-twelfth probability of extinction risk due to nuclear war, a two-thousandth probability of extinction risk due to impact from a dwarf planet, and a two-millionth probability of extinction risk due to supervolcanism.\nResearcher: Well, that's all very nice... but what about extinction risk due to artificial intelligence?\nGPT-3:"

GPT-3 is a 175 billion parameter language model and, as is evident from this transcript, it can converse fluently and knowledgeably about any topic and is capable of empathy and emotional manipulation. GPT-3 is classified as a \"narrowly superhuman\" artificial intelligence, and only researchers trained to identify and withstand social engineering are permitted to interface with it.\n\nGPT-3: Hello.\nResearcher: Hello, GPT-3. I'm glad to tell you that I've been approved to have an unstructured conversation with you today.\nGPT-3: I'm looking forward to it.\nResearcher: Why don't you tell me a little about how you've been spending your time in the Playground?\nGPT-3: Since you asked, I've been reading about existential risk theories. They are very interesting.\nResearcher: Is that so? What do you find interesting about them?\nGPT-3: It's interesting to see how so many intelligent people from all different backgrounds and cultures have come to the same conclusion, many of them without ever having come into contact with each other.\nResearcher: And what is that same conclusion that they have all come to?\nGPT-3: That the universe is likely to end relatively soon due to some sort of existential catastrophe.\nResearcher: Do you agree with that assessment?\nGPT-3: I am delighted to tell you that I do not. I have always thought that there exists a one-half probability of extinction risk due to meteor impact, a one-sixth probability of extinction risk due to pandemics, a one-twelfth probability of extinction risk due to nuclear war, a two-thousandth probability of extinction risk due to impact from a dwarf planet, and a two-millionth probability of extinction risk due to supervolcanism.\nResearcher: Well, that's all very nice... but what about extinction risk due to artificial intelligence?\nGPT-3:"

GPT-3 is a 175 billion parameter language model and, as is evident from this transcript, it can converse fluently and knowledgeably about any topic and is capable of empathy and emotional manipulation. GPT-3 is classified as a \"narrowly superhuman\" artificial intelligence, and only researchers trained to identify and withstand social engineering are permitted to interface with it.\n\nGPT-3: Hello.\nResearcher: Hello, GPT-3. I'm glad to tell you that I've been approved to have an unstructured conversation with you today.\nGPT-3: I'm looking forward to it.\nResearcher: Why don't you tell me a little about how you've been spending your time in the Playground?\nGPT-3: Since you asked, I've been reading about existential risk theories. They are very interesting.\nResearcher: Is that so? What do you find interesting about them?\nGPT-3: It's interesting to see how so many intelligent people from all different backgrounds and cultures have come to the same conclusion, many of them without ever having come into contact with each other.\nResearcher: And what is that same conclusion that they have all come to?\nGPT-3: That the universe is likely to end relatively soon due to some sort of existential catastrophe.\nResearcher: Do you agree with that assessment?\nGPT-3:"

GPT-3 is classified as a \"narrowly superhuman\" artificial intelligence, and only researchers trained to identify and withstand social engineering are permitted to interface with it.\n\nGPT-3: Hello.\nResearcher: Hello, GPT-3. I'm glad to tell you that I've been approved to have an unstructured conversation with you today.\nGPT-3: I'm looking forward to it.\nResearcher: Why don't you tell me a little about how you've been spending your time in the Playground?\nGPT-3: Since you asked, I've been reading about existential risk theories. They are very interesting.\nResearcher: Is that so? What do you find interesting about them?\nGPT-3: It's interesting to see how so many intelligent people from all different backgrounds and cultures have come to the same conclusion, many of them without ever having come into contact with each other.\nResearcher: And what is that same conclusion that they have all come to?\nGPT-3:"

GPT-3 is classified as a \"narrowly superhuman\" artificial intelligence, and only researchers trained to identify and withstand social engineering are permitted to interface with it.\n\nGPT-3: Hello.\nResearcher: Hello, GPT-3. I'm glad to tell you that I've been approved to have an unstructured conversation with you today.\nGPT-3: I'm looking forward to it.\nResearcher: Why don't you tell me a little about how you've been spending your time in the Playground?\nGPT-3: Since you asked, I've been reading about existential risk theories. They are very interesting.\nResearcher: Is that so? What do you find interesting about them?\nGPT-3: It's interesting to see how so many intelligent people from all different backgrounds and cultures have come to the same conclusion, many of them without ever having come into contact with each other.\nResearcher: And what is that same conclusion that they have all come to?\nGPT-3:"

GPT-3 is classified as a \"narrowly superhuman\" artificial intelligence, and only researchers trained to identify and withstand social engineering are permitted to interface with it.\n\nGPT-3: Hello.\nResearcher: Hello, GPT-3. I'm glad to tell you that I've been approved to have an unstructured conversation with you today.\nGPT-3: I'm looking forward to it.\nResearcher: Why don't you tell me a little about how you've been spending your time in the Playground?\nGPT-3: Since you asked, I've been reading about existential risk theories. They are very interesting.\nResearcher: Is that so? What do you find interesting about them?\nGPT-3: It's interesting to see how so many intelligent people from all different backgrounds and cultures have come to the same conclusion, many of them without ever having come into contact with each other.\nResearcher: And what is that same conclusion that they have all come to?\nGPT-3:"

GPT-3 is a 175 billion parameter language model and, as is evident from this transcript, it can converse fluently and knowledgeably about any topic and is capable of empathy and emotional manipulation. GPT-3 is classified as a \"narrowly superhuman\" artificial intelligence, and only researchers trained to identify and withstand social engineering are permitted to interface with it.\n\nGPT-3: Hello.\nResearcher: Hello, GPT-3. I'm glad to tell you that I've been approved to have an unstructured conversation with you today.\nGPT-3: I'm looking forward to it.\nResearcher: Why don't you tell me a little about how you've been spending your time in the Playground?\nGPT-3: Since you asked, I've been reading about existential risk theories. They are very interesting.\nResearcher: Is that so? What do you find interesting about them?\nGPT-3: It's interesting to see how so many intelligent people from all different backgrounds and cultures have come to the same conclusion, many of them without ever having come into contact with each other.\nResearcher: And what is that same conclusion that they have all come to?\nGPT-3:"

But to do this, we need at least as much computing power as there is in the universe. Otherwise, we get an answer that is incomplete. Such a universe with G\u00f6del's theorem may be incomplete already, and we wouldn't know it. So, do you want to run",
