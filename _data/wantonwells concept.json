An area of particular natural beauty it was once a self-sustaining upland settlement but has since suffered depopulation over the last century which threatens the loss of the heritage and history of this unique area. The Cabrach Trust was established in 2011 with a vision to regenerate the Cabrach as a thriving and sustainable community, creating jobs, attracting visitors whilst protecting and celebrating the history, landscape and heritage for future generations. To achieve these goals The Cabrach Trust has developed a community led regeneration strategy that will see the development of projects such as a historic Distillery and a new Heritage Centre on the Trust's land.\n",
