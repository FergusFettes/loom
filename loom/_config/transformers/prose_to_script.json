I promise you will not be graded on the answer. I only want to know your own, honest reply. Why not?\"\nHarry had that helpless feeling again. Thou shalt not become a Dark Lord was such an obvious theorem in his moral system that it was hard to describe the actual proof steps. \"Um, people would get hurt?\"\n\"Surely you've wanted to hurt people,\" said Professor Quirrell. \"You wanted to hurt those bullies today. Being a Dark Lord means that people you want to hurt get hurt.\"\nHarry floundered for words and then decided to simply go with the obvious. \"First of all, just because I want to hurt someone doesn't mean it's right -\"\n\"What makes something right, if not your wanting it?\"\n\"Ah,\" Harry said, \"preference utilitarianism.\"\n\"Pardon me?\" said Professor Quirrell.\n\nRewritten as a script:\n\n- Professor Quirrell: I won't repeat what you're about to say.\n- Harry: The Sorting Hat did seem to think I was going to end up as a Dark Lord unless I went to Hufflepuff.
