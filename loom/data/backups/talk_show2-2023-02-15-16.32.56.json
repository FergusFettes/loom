This ubiquitous baggage in natural, familiar model species obscures the plasticity and swarm intelligence of cellular collectives. Significant gaps exist in our understanding of the origin of anatomical novelty, of the relationship between genome and form, and of strategies for control of large-scale structure and function in regenerative medicine and bioengineering. Analysis of living forms that have never existed before is necessary to reveal deep design principles of life as it can be. We briefly review existing examples of chimaeras, cyborgs, hybrots and other beings along the spectrum containing evolved and designed systems. To drive experimental progress in multicellular synthetic morphology, we propose teleonomic (goal-seeking, problem-solving) behaviour in diverse problem spaces as a powerful invariant across possible beings regardless of composition or origin. Cybernetic perspectives on chimaeric morphogenesis erase artificial distinctions established by past limitations of technology and imagination. We suggest that a multi-scale competency architecture facilitates evolution of robust problem-solving, living machines. Creation and analysis of novel living forms will be an essential testbed for the emerging field of diverse intelligence, with numerous implications across regenerative medicine, robotics and ethics.\"\n\nOutline: Host comes on, introduces the hybrot orchestra and talks about the guests that will be on the show:\n- a chimera\n- a chiroptoid from Saturn's moon Titan\n- an intelligent cell\n- a silicon-based entity\n- a frog that lives in the water\n- the transforming skin bag\n\nHost: \"Greetings, viewers. I'm Jessy Sun, but you can call me the super prokaryote in a human suit, because through the miracle of evolution, we're all made of chemicals. In fact, we're all such miracles that atheists pray to me when their soap bubbles won't burst.\n\"First, let me introduce the band, the Humming Hybrots [a hybrot is a robot with an organic brain-- in this case all different kinds of instect neurologies]:\n- on the keyboard, a synthetic synthoid, this fellow is based on a bioprinted cricket architecture which was trained on all the wildest jazz pianists of",
